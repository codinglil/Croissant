        <ul>
           <li>The original croissant was called Kipfel and originated
        in Austria in 1683.</li> 
        <li>It was created in honor of the Austrian victory over
        the Turks and modeled after the crescent on the Turkish flag. (Some
        historians say the croissant originated in Hungary) August Zang, an
        Austrian artillery officer, is credited with bringing the croissant to
        France when he opened his own Viennese bakery in Paris. (Some say it was
        Marie Antoinette who brought the croissant to France...)</li>
        <li>The Croissant became the French national product in 1920.</li> 
        <li>The Croissant started as a luxury product, but by the end of the nineteenth century, it was
        middle-class (the rich preferred a good brioche).</li> 
        <li>Before the modern
        croissant, puff pastry was used as a garnish or shell, not to eat on its
        own.</li>
        </ul>
